# CS455/EE407 Wireless Sensor Network/DVHop Project. 
Team Will Design a virtual Wireless Sensor Network using NS3. This virtual network will use a DVHOP algorithm to find a theoretical location for each node, that does not have GPS capability.

GOALS
- [x] Get DVhop working with NS3_30.
- [x] Design and build a WSN topology with the DV-Hop code.
- [x] Test, simulate and collect data from the WSN with the DV-Hop code.
- [x] Make nodes die gradually.
- [x] Simulate and collect data from a degraded WSN with the DV-Hop code.
- [x] Work on Documentation and Presentation

# Downloading & Configuring our simulation program
> OS requirements: Ubuntu 20.04 or equivalent 
>
> To run our simulation program, you must have NS3.30.1 installed in your
> home directory. (`/home/[USER]/ns-allinone-3.30.1`)
